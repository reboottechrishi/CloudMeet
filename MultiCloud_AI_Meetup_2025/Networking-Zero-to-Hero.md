- Basic networking
- LAB : how to configure Switch brought from market? like namming, multiple VLANs,Port assignation of VLAN
       : Will setup two host machine in diffrent VLAN and try to connect
       : will setup two host in same VLAN and try to connect
       : Requirenent of Router/L3 switch to connect different VLNS

- LAB2:Connect your VPC to other networks
       :Enable internet access for a VPC using an internet gateway
       :Connect to the internet or other networks using NAT devices
       :Associate Elastic IP addresses with resources in your VPC
       :Connect your VPC to other VPCs and networks using a transit gateway
       :Connect your VPC to remote networks using AWS Virtual Private Network
       : Connect VPCs using VPC peering
