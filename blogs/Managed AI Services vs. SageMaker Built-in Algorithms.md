#### **The SageMaker Workflow**
1.Fetch, clean, and prepare Data -->2.Trail and evaluate model -->3.Deploy models, evaluate results in production
[Sagemker Traning and Deployment architecture](coming ..)
1.  **Fetch, clean, and prepare data:** Data usually comes from S3, but SageMaker can also ingest from other services like Athena and Redshift. **SageMaker Processing** jobs copy data from S3, spin up a container, and output processed data back to S3.

2.  **Train and evaluate model:**
    -   **Training Jobs:** You create a training job by specifying the location of your data in S3, the ML compute resources, and the output location. You can use built-in algorithms, frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, or even your own custom Docker images.
    -   **SageMaker Ground Truth:** This service manages human labelers to annotate your data for training purposes. It uses a smart approach, only sending images the model is unsure about to human reviewers, which can significantly reduce costs. The labelers can be your own employees, professional labeling companies, or the crowdsourcing marketplace **Amazon Mechanical Turk**.

3.  **Deploy models, evaluate results in production:**
    -   **Deployment:** Trained models saved to S3 can be deployed in two ways:
        -   **Persistent Endpoint:** For real-time predictions on demand.
        -   **SageMaker Batch Transform:** For getting predictions on an entire dataset at once.
    -   **SageMaker Model Monitoring:** This service, which integrates with **SageMaker Clarify**, helps you get alerts on quality deviations and potential bias in your deployed models. It can detect data drift and other anomalies, visualizing them in CloudWatch.

#### **SageMaker Tools and Features**
- **SageMaker Notebooks:** SageMaker Notebook Instances on EC2 are spun up from the console 
    • S3 data access
    • Scikit_learn, Spark, Tensorflow
    • Wide variety of built-in models

#### 4. Exploring SageMaker Data Wrangler

**SageMaker Data Wrangler** is a powerful visual interface used to aggregate, explore, and prepare data for building ML or GenAI solutions. While you can access it directly within SageMaker Studio, it's also the engine that powers the data preparation features in Canvas.

Data Wrangler simplifies the process of transforming and cleaning data, making it easier to build accurate models. It connects to various data sources and allows you to visualize your data before applying transformations, which is crucial for identifying patterns and potential issues. 

## Part2: SageMaker Built-in Algorithms

AWS SageMaker offers a rich collection of built-in algorithms that simplify the machine learning process. Instead of creating and managing your own container from scratch, you can use these pre-packaged models for common applications, saving time and effort. This overview covers the input modes for training jobs and details various algorithms and their specific use cases.

***

#### SageMaker Input Modes for Training Jobs

When setting up a training job, you must configure how SageMaker accesses your datasets from S3. The choice of input mode impacts training time and cost.

* **S3 File Mode:** This is the default mode. It copies all training data from S3 to a local directory on the Docker container. This is suitable for **small datasets and training jobs** where the data can fit entirely on the instance's storage. The main drawback is the time spent waiting for the data to be copied.
* **S3 Fast File Mode:** This mode streams the data from S3 to the container, similar to Pipe mode, but with the added ability to perform **random access** to the data. This significantly speeds up training by eliminating the initial data download wait time. It's a popular choice for developers.
* **FSx for Lustre:** This option is ideal for **massive-scale training jobs** that require hundreds of gigabytes of throughput and millions of IOPS with low latency. It’s a managed file system that integrates with SageMaker and is a great choice when dealing with extremely large datasets.
* **EFS:** This mode requires that your data is already stored in an Amazon EFS file system and is well-suited for scenarios where you need to share a file system across multiple training instances.

#### A Guide to Key SageMaker Built-in Algorithms

Here's a breakdown of some of the most popular SageMaker built-in algorithms and their applications.

* **Linear Learner:** This is a supervised learning algorithm that can handle both **regression (numeric prediction)** and **classification (binary or multi-class)** problems. It fits a linear function to your training data and uses a linear threshold for classification. It prefers data in the `recordIO-protobuf` format but also supports CSV.

* **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** A highly popular and efficient algorithm that uses a boosted group of decision trees. It excels in both **regression and classification** tasks. You can use it directly within a SageMaker notebook or as a built-in algorithm for larger-scale training jobs on a fleet of instances. It supports various training input formats including CSV and `recordIO-protobuf`.

* **LightGBM:** Similar to XGBoost, this is another gradient boosting decision tree algorithm. It is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a powerful choice for both regression and classification problems.

* **Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence):** A supervised learning algorithm for tasks where the input is a sequence of tokens and the output is another sequence of tokens. Common use cases include **machine translation, text summarization, and speech-to-text**. It requires data in the `recordIO-protobuf` format with a vocabulary file mapping words to numbers.

* **DeepAR:** This algorithm is specifically designed for **forecasting one-dimensional time series data** using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It's a great tool for predicting future values based on historical data, like stock prices. It accepts input in JSON, GIP, or Parquet format.

* **BlazingText:** This algorithm has two main use cases:
    * **Text Classification:** A supervised learning system for predicting labels for sentences, useful in web searches and information retrieval.
    * **Word2Vec:** An unsupervised learning model that creates vector representations of words (word embeddings), where semantically similar words are represented by vectors that are close to each other. This is a foundational technique for many NLP tasks.

* **Object2vec:** A more general-purpose embedding algorithm than Word2vec. It learns low-dimensional embeddings for **arbitrary objects** (not just words), making it useful for finding similarities between various data points. The training data consists of tokenized integer pairs or sequences.

* **Object Detection:** This computer vision algorithm identifies all objects in an image by drawing **bounding boxes** around them and classifying each object. It's built on a deep neural network and can be trained from scratch or using pre-trained models.

* **Image Classification:** This algorithm assigns one or more **labels to an entire image**, but it does not specify the location of the objects. It can be used in full training mode (random initial weights) or in transfer learning mode (using pre-trained weights for faster training).

* **Semantic Segmentation:** This algorithm performs **pixel-level object classification**, which is more granular than image classification or object detection. It produces a segmentation mask, making it useful for self-driving vehicles and medical imaging.

* **Random Cut Forest (RCF):** An **unsupervised anomaly detection** algorithm. RCF is highly effective at identifying unexpected spikes, breaks in periodicity, or unclassifiable data points in time series data, assigning an anomaly score to each data point. It's also integrated into Kinesis Analytics for real-time anomaly detection.

* **Neural Topic Model (NTM):** An **unsupervised learning** algorithm that organizes documents into topics based on the statistical distribution of words. It's a deep learning approach that defines topics as a latent representation of top-ranking words.

* **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** Another **unsupervised topic modeling** algorithm that groups documents based on a shared subset of words. Unlike NTM, it is not a deep learning algorithm.

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) & K-Means:**
    * **KNN:** A simple supervised algorithm for **classification and regression**. It finds the `K` closest data points to a new sample and uses their labels (classification) or average value (regression) to make a prediction.
    * **K-Means:** An **unsupervised clustering** algorithm that divides data into `K` groups, or clusters, where members within each group are as similar as possible based on Euclidean distance.

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** An **unsupervised dimensionality reduction** algorithm. PCA projects high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while minimizing information loss. The new dimensions are called components, with the first component having the largest variability.

* **Factorization Machines:** A supervised learning algorithm designed to handle **sparse data** and capture interactions between features. It is commonly used for click-through prediction and recommender systems.

* **IP Insights:** An **unsupervised learning** algorithm that learns the usage patterns of specific IP addresses and entities (like user IDs). It automatically identifies and scores suspicious behavior, such as logins from anomalous IP addresses, to detect fraudulent activity.
