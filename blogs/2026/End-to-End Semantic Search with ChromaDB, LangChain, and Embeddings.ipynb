    "# 📘 Appendix: Q&A (ChromaDB + LangChain + Ollama)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is the main goal of this notebook?\n",
    "**Answer:** To build an end-to-end semantic search pipeline using LangChain, Ollama embeddings, and ChromaDB, including loading text, splitting, embedding, indexing, searching, and persisting the vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q2. Which Python packages are installed at the beginning?\n",
    "**Answer:** langchain, langchain-chroma, langchain-community, chromadb, and python-dotenv.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q3. Why is Ollama required in this workflow?\n",
    "**Answer:** It provides the local embedding model (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`) used by OllamaEmbeddings to convert text into vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q4. How do you start the Ollama server?\n",
    "**Answer:** Run `ollama serve` in a terminal and keep it running in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q5. How do you download the `nomic-embed-text` model for embeddings?\n",
    "**Answer:** Execute `ollama pull nomic-embed-text` in the same terminal where Ollama is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q6. What does TextLoader do in this notebook?\n",
    "**Answer:** It reads the file `speech.txt` and returns a list of LangChain `Document` objects for downstream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q7. What Python objects does `loader.load()` return?\n",
    "**Answer:** A list of `Document` objects, each with `page_content` and `metadata`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q8. Why do we split documents into chunks before embedding?\n",
    "**Answer:** To respect model/context size limits and improve retrieval quality by indexing smaller, focused pieces of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q9. Which splitter is used and with what parameters?\n",
    "**Answer:** `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with `chunk_size=500` and `chunk_overlap=0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q10. What does `OllamaEmbeddings(model=\"nomic-embed-text\")` do?\n",
    "**Answer:** It configures LangChain to generate embeddings locally using the `nomic-embed-text` model hosted by Ollama.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q11. What is the purpose of `Chroma.from_documents(...)`?\n",
    "**Answer:** It creates a ChromaDB vector store by computing embeddings for the provided documents and indexing them for similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q12. What does `vectordb.similarity_search(query)` return?\n",
    "**Answer:** A list of the most relevant `Document` objects to the query, typically ordered by cosine similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q13. In the example, what does `docs[0].page_content` represent?\n",
    "**Answer:** The text content of the top-most similar chunk retrieved from the vector store for the given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q14. How do you persist the ChromaDB index to disk?\n",
    "**Answer:** Provide a `persist_directory` when creating the store, e.g., `Chroma.from_documents(..., persist_directory=\"./chroma.db\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q15. How can you reload a previously persisted ChromaDB store?\n",
    "**Answer:** Initialize it with the same directory and embedding function, e.g., `Chroma(persist_directory=\"./chroma.db\", embedding_function=embedding)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q16. What happens if `ollama serve` is not running when generating embeddings?\n",
    "**Answer:** Embedding requests will fail (connection/refused errors) because the local embedding server is unreachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q17. Why might you set a `chunk_overlap > 0`?\n",
    "**Answer:** To preserve context that spans chunk boundaries, which can improve retrieval for long sentences or cross-paragraph references.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q18. Which similarity metric is commonly used by Chroma for semantic search?\n",
    "**Answer:** Cosine similarity (as implied by the similarity search description).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q19. How do you change the number of results returned by similarity search?\n",
    "**Answer:** Pass `k`, e.g., `vectordb.similarity_search(query, k=5)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q20. Does ChromaDB require a cloud service to run?\n",
    "**Answer:** No. It works locally and is well-suited for small-to-medium projects without cloud dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q21. What is RAG and how does this pipeline support it?\n",
    "**Answer:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines retrieval (via Chroma similarity search) with generation (LLMs). This notebook builds the retrieval layer needed for RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q22. How is metadata used in ChromaDB?\n",
    "**Answer:** Chroma stores embeddings alongside metadata (e.g., file name, chunk ID), enabling filtering and better traceability of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q23. Can you filter results by metadata during search?\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, you can supply a `filter` dict to the search call (supported by Chroma via LangChain) to restrict matches based on metadata fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q24. How can you reset or recreate the vector database from scratch?\n",
    "**Answer:** Delete the `persist_directory` (e.g., `./chroma.db`) or specify a new directory/collection and rebuild from your documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q25. Why is `python-dotenv` included in the install even if not shown in code?\n",
    "**Answer:** It's commonly used to load environment variables (e.g., API keys) in notebooks and is often included for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q26. Which input file is ingested by this example pipeline?\n",
    "**Answer:** The plain text file `speech.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q27. What example query is demonstrated in the notebook?\n",
    "**Answer:** \"What is core technology behind LLMs ?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q28. How can you improve retrieval quality beyond character-based splitting?\n",
    "**Answer:** Consider semantic or token-based splitters, add overlap, tune chunk sizes, and enrich metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q29. How do you ensure results are reproducible across runs?\n",
    "**Answer:** Persist the DB, keep chunking parameters constant, use the same embedding model, and maintain the same pre-processing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Q30. What Python version does the notebook metadata indicate?\n",
    "**Answer:** Python 3.12.5 (as listed in the notebook's language_info metadata).\n"
