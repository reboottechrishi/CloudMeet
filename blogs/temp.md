# Story 1 

We propose building our very own **"Cloud Navigator"** â€“ an in-house FinOps cost optimization solution. This isn't just about cutting costs; it's about intelligent resource management, ensuring our infrastructure perfectly matches our needs, eliminating waste, and ultimately, maximizing our return on investment in the cloud. Think of it as installing a sophisticated real-time fuel management system and a seasoned captain who knows exactly when and where to optimize. 

This **"Cloud Navigator"** will give us the power to:

- Rightsize our engines (EC2 and Databases): Are we using a super-tanker engine for a small dinghy? This tool will tell us exactly what size engine we need based on actual usage, saving us significant fuel.
- Spot hidden leaks (Cost Anomaly Detection): It'll be like a proactive sensor that immediately alerts us to any unexpected spikes in fuel consumption, helping us prevent costly surprises.
- See the entire fleet (Resource Inventory Dashboard): We'll have a clear, interactive map of all our resources and their current status, providing complete visibility.
- Get expert advice (Trusted Advisor Integration): We'll leverage AWS's own best practices, customized to our goals, to guide our optimization efforts.
- Tag enforement - ensure right tags are enforced for cost 



**1. Task 1: Rightsizing Recommendations for AWS EC2 Servers**

**Problem Statement:** Many EC2 instances are often over-provisioned, meaning they have more CPU, memory, or network capacity than they actually use. This leads to unnecessary costs.
**Solution:** The "Cloud Navigator" will collect and analyze CPU utilization, memory utilization (requiring CloudWatch Agent), network I/O, and disk I/O metrics for our EC2 instances over a 30-60 day period.

**Mechanism:** Using this historical data, it will identify instances that are consistently underutilized or, conversely, those that might be constrained and benefiting from an upgrade. The tool will then recommend a more appropriately sized EC2 instance type (e.g., downsizing from a m5.large to a t3.medium if usage patterns allow, or suggesting a move to Graviton-based instances for better price-performance).


**2. Task 2: Rightsizing Recommendations for AWS Databases (RDS)**

**Problem Statement:** Similar to EC2, Amazon RDS instances can also be over-provisioned in terms of instance type, storage, or IOPS, leading to inflated costs. Idle database instances also contribute to waste.

**Solution:** The "Cloud Navigator" will analyze database-specific metrics such as CPU utilization, database connections, storage utilization, IOPS, and throughput for our RDS instances over the specified look-back period. It will also consider Amazon RDS Performance Insights data if enabled.

**Mechanism:** It will identify idle databases, recommend appropriate instance types for optimized or under-provisioned workloads, and suggest adjustments to storage types or provisioned IOPS.

 
**3. Task 3: AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and Cost Anomaly Detection**

**Problem Statement:** Unexpected spikes in cloud spending can occur due to misconfigurations, runaway processes, or unoptimized resource usage. Identifying these anomalies quickly is crucial to prevent large, surprise bills.

**Solution:**  The "Cloud Navigator" will integrate with AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) to ingest detailed billing data. It will then apply machine learning algorithms to establish a baseline of our normal spending patterns.

**Mechanism:**  The tool will continuously monitor incoming billing data (potentially multiple times a day as data becomes available) and flag any significant deviations from the established baseline as a cost anomaly. For detected anomalies, it will provide root cause analysis, identifying the contributing AWS services, linked accounts, or even cost allocation tags. Alerts will be sent via pre-defined channels (e.g., email, Slack).

 
**4. Task 4: Create Dashboard for AWS Resources Inventory**

**Problem Statement:**  In a large AWS environment, it can be challenging to maintain a clear, unified view of all deployed resources across multiple accounts and regions. This lack of visibility can hinder optimization efforts and introduce operational risks.

**Solution:**  The "Cloud Navigator" will integrate with AWS Config and other AWS APIs to create a centralized, interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive inventory of all our AWS resources.

**Mechanism:** This dashboard will display resource counts, their metadata (e.g., instance type, region, tags), and their current status. It will allow filtering by account, region, service, and custom tags (e.g., by application, team, or environment), acting as a simplified Configuration Management Database (CMDB).


**5. Task 5: AWS Trusted Advisor Integration and Cost Optimization Lens**

**Problem Statement:**  AWS Trusted Advisor offers valuable recommendations across various pillars, including cost optimization. However, its recommendations need to be consistently monitored and acted upon, and often require context specific to our organizational goals.

**Solution:** The "Cloud Navigator" will integrate with AWS Trusted Advisor to pull its cost optimization recommendations. We will then build a "cost optimization lens" within our solution that prioritizes these recommendations based on potential savings, business impact, and our internal policies.

**Mechanism:**  The tool will display Trusted Advisor's idle resource checks (e.g., idle EC2 instances, underutilized EBS volumes, idle RDS instances), Reserved Instance optimization opportunities, and other cost-saving suggestions. Our "lens" will add a layer of intelligent prioritization and tracking, allowing teams to focus on the most impactful actions first.
Business Value: Leverages AWS's native best practices for cost optimization. Provides actionable insights, simplifying the process of identifying and acting on cost-saving opportunities. Ensures continuous improvement in our cloud cost efficiency.

**6. Task 6: Tag Enforement**

**Problem Statement:**  Ensure right tags are enforced for cost.

## Story 2 

**The Cloud Adoption Accelerator: Charting Our Path to Digital Agility** Our "cloud-first" strategy isn't just a buzzword; it's a strategic imperative. It's about transforming from a fixed infrastructure model to an agile, elastic, and continuously innovative platform. We're moving from a world of large upfront capital expenditures (CapEx) for hardware we might need, to an operational expenditure (OpEx) model where we pay only for what we actually use.


App will function similarly to AWS Migration Evaluator (formerly ModelizeIt) by collecting key infrastructure metrics, analyzing current resource utilization, and then mapping these requirements to suitable AWS services. It will generate detailed reports outlining:

- Cost Comparison: A clear financial comparison between the current state (on-prem/other cloud) and the projected cost in AWS, including potential savings.
- Migration Benefits: Quantifiable and qualitative benefits beyond cost, such as improved performance, scalability, resilience, and access to new AWS services.
- Service Recommendations: Specific AWS service and configuration recommendations (e.g., EC2 instance types, RDS options, container services like ECS/EKS, serverless options like Lambda, storage solutions like S3/EBS/EFS).


- Golden assessment" checklist (10-15 questions) for best practices
- Create cost lense
